      <p>As of pre-pandemic until now, I got into fitness and tried many workout programs.</p>
      <p>My fitness goals are that I would like to master advanced calisthenics exercises and be able to push/squat above two plates.</p>

       <p>One of my passions throughout highschool was Robotics. Through Robotics I learned mechanical fundamentals such as using machines like the Lathe, Drill press and the Mill machine.</p>
       <p>Although Robotics can get intense at times when certain code or motor functions don't work, we're always able to get it done through our team support and skilled mentors.</p>

     <h3>Sports</h3>
     <div class="sports">
       <img src="images/nets_team.png" alt="">
       <p>I've been playing basketball casually since I was a kid, getting great pickup games at my local park. I didn't become a fan of the NBA until 2018</p>
       <p>Thanks to D'Lo Russel, the Nets are as formibbadle as ever</p>
